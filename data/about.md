initiative.sh's design philosophy is to minimize the time and effort between the
question ("Is there a blacksmith nearby?") and the answer ("Yes, it's called
Frosthammer & Sons, and Fenrik Frosthammer is at the forge.").

It aims to do that through three principles:

* **Keyboard first:** All commands can be typed. Most can be run at any time, so
  you don't need to waste time navigating menus to find the tool you want.
* **Context:** With your help, initiative.sh will track your party's location
  and the demographics in the area. If you're in a dwarvish settlement, the
  innkeeper and most of the patrons will probably be dwarves. (Work in
  progress.)
* **Persistence:** The people and places you generate are saved and visible in
  your scrollback history, so you don't need to worry about forgetting to
  scribble down a generated name that came up in conversation. (Work in
  progress.)

*(initiative.sh is under active development and not all features described have
been implemented yet. Please check back regularly for updates, which will be
published in the `changelog`.)*
