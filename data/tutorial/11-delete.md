# Tutorial: Deleting Things

{npc_name} fought valiantly, but is no match for our intrepid band of "heroes".
Rather than defend {inn_name} to the death, {they} {slip} out the back door.
The players may have made a new enemy today, but {inn_name} is left to burn to
the ground. No chance of a repeat visit in this campaign after all.

You can delete {inn_name} from your journal with `delete {inn_name}`.
