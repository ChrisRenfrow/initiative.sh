Yikes, that's a lot of dice. {inn_name} is on fire and {npc_name} isn't looking
so good, but it's {their} bar and {theyre} not going down without a fight.
{they_cap} {pull} a weapon from behind the bar, but what kind?

Fortunately, initiative.sh includes a list of `weapons`, so you can choose
something appropriate.
