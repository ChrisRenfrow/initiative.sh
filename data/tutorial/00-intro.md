# Tutorial: Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through the basics of initiative.sh and introduce
you to its design principles.

In short, initiative.sh is keyboard-first. Rather than forcing you to navigate
menus and wait for pages to load in order to find what you're looking for, you
can simply type the name of the thing you want.

To make it easier to discover new commands and features, commands will often be
exposed in text, like the `tutorial` you're following right now. These
underlined words can be typed or clicked at any time.

Some shortcuts only make sense in context. For instance, going to the ~next~
step of the tutorial is only possible from this step. These temporary commands
are shown with a dashed underline.

Type ~next~ to continue. You can type ~cancel~ at any time to end the tutorial.
