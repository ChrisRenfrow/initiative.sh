## Tutorial

Great! You'll notice that initiative.sh didn't limit itself to generating one
inn - it also generated ten alternatives for you to choose from. For now, we'll
just go with the first suggestion, {inn_name}. There's a temporary command
available right now, as indicated by the dotted underline above: ~save~ will
save the most recently generated thing.

Type ~save~ to save {inn_name} to your journal and continue the tutorial.
