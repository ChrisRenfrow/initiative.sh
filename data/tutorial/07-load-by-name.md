# Tutorial: Loading From Journal

Unless saved to your journal, only a limited number of generated things like
inns and characters will be stored at a time. Furthermore, your journal is saved
locally in your browser, allowing you to refer back to past sessions as needed.

You can recall the profile of any person or place you've saved previously by
typing its name, like our friendly bartender, `{npc_name}`.
