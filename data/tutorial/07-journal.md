# Tutorial: The Journal

By editing a generated character, initiative.sh assumes you're preparing to use
her in your campaign and automatically saves her to your journal. There's no
need to use the explicit save command the way we did with {inn_name}.

So what is this journal we've been talking about, anyway? You can see the items
currently in the journal by typing `journal`.
