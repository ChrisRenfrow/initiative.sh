# Tutorial: SRD Reference

Players being players, the situation in this bar have gone downhill quick. The
wizard decides to cast Fireball, but can't remember how many dice he needs.
Fortunately, initiative.sh includes quick reference material from the D&D System
Reference Document. Just type `Fireball` to see the spell description.

Note that reference lookups such as journal entries and spells must be
capitalized (Fireball, {npc_name}), while commands are lowercase (npc, journal).
