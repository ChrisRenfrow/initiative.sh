Commands are intended to be typed, although some words are clickable to make it easier to discover new commands. They're also intended to be as intuitive and succinct as possible.

To generate a random thing, simply type its name. Generators will include a list of alternatives, in case the first suggestion isn't appropriate to your situation. You can see more details about an alternative by typing its name or number.

* `npc` (`human`, `elf`, etc.)
* `building` (`inn`, `temple`, etc.)

Proper nouns will give you existing people, places, or reference items from the D&D 5e SRD. For instance:

* spells (`Acid Arrow` to `Zone Of Truth`)
* the name of any NPC you've previously generated
* more to come
