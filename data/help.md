Commands are intended to be typed, although underlined words are also clickable
to make it easier to discover new commands. They're also intended to be as
intuitive and succinct as possible.

To generate a random thing, simply type its name. Generators will include a list
of alternatives, in case the first suggestion isn't appropriate to your
situation. You can see more details about an alternative by typing its name or
the number listed next to it.

* `npc` (`human`, `elf`, etc.)
* `building` (`inn`, `temple`, etc.)

Proper (capitalized) nouns will give you existing people, places, or reference
items from the 5th edition D&D Systems Reference Document. For instance:

* `spells` (`Acid Arrow` to `Zone Of Truth`)
* `weapons`, `adventuring gear`, `tools`, etc. (`Abacus` to `Yew Wand`)
* the name of any NPC you've previously generated
* more to come

You can save any generated thing to your journal by typing `save [name]`. Saved
things will be available next time you visit the site. You can get a list of all
saved things with `journal`.
