# initiative.sh

Initiative.sh is a storytelling aid for game masters. It's specifically designed
to be used at the table, to support the creative process as your sessions evolve
in real time.

To that end, it's intended to minimize the time and effort between the question
("is there a blacksmith nearby?") and the answer ("yes, it's called Frosthammer
& Sons, and Fenrik Frosthammer is currently at the forge"). It does this with a
few simple design principles:

## Text-based interface

Just type the name of the thing you're looking for. Nouns ("inn", "npc",
"human") will generate a new thing of that type, as well as a bunch of
alternatives in case you're not wild about the first suggestion. Typing a proper
noun ("Hidden Tiger Inn") will load a saved location.

## Context

With your help, initiative.sh will track your party's location and the
demographics in that area. If your party walks into a tavern in a dwarven
settlement, most of the patrons will be dwarves, so you don't have to spend your
time paging past results that make no sense in the current context.

## Persistence (premium)

Ever forget to write down a generated name or location after making it canon?
If you use initiative.sh to manage your notes, you can simply tell it which
generated content to save and the Humble Hedgehog will be ready and waiting next
time your players return to Rust Bottom.

## Integrations (premium)

Music, maps, and smart lighting all add to the game experience, but it can be
hard to orchestrate all of that and tell a coherent story at the same time. By
setting up integrations, you can use context changes in initiative.sh to trigger
updates in your game environment. When the party enters an inn, you can trigger
a Spotify playlist and have your lights grow dimmer and warmer.
